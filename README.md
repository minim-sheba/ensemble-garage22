Code and assets for piece for Ensemble Garage 2022.
This work is a collaboration between Caitlin Rowley (@minim-sheba) and Josh Spear, members of Bastard Assignments, and is for percussion and live electronics.
The code and assets lodged here comprise the live electronics, written in PureData for use with a Bela Mini audio computer (http://bela.io) with Multichannel Expander, four contact microphones and a Trill Bar sensor.
## Code notes
_main.pd is the file which is uploaded to the Bela Mini. Numbered/dated files are archives of versions which have developed further (from before starting to use GitHub)
## Acknowledgements
This work has been commissioned by Ensemble Garage for their project with Bastard Assignments and will be premiered in Cologne on 19 August 2022. We have also received support from Zubin Kanga's Cyborg Soloists project in the form of equipment loans (Bela Mini computer, contact mics) and support time from Cyborg Soloists' collaborator (and creators of the Bela and Trill systems) Augmented Instruments Lab.
